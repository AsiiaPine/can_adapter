# STM32G0B1CEU6 USB-CAN Converter

This project implements a SLCAN USB-CAN converter using the STM32G0B1CEU6 microcontroller. The device provides two CAN interfaces (FDCAN1 and FDCAN2) accessible via USB CDC (Virtual COM Port). 

## Features

- **Dual CAN Interfaces**: Two independent CAN controllers (FDCAN1 and FDCAN2)
- **USB Communication**: CDC (Virtual COM Port) interface for easy integration
- **Configurable Terminators**: Software-controlled CAN bus terminators
- **LED Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for device status and CAN activity
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection and reporting
